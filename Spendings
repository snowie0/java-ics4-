/* The code above works but it doesnt shows the number with 2 decimals  or in (%.2f) format, and I could not use both position and decimal formats in one statements so I made another code which meets with the requirements but it doesnt look professional and not uses what we learned with formatting. I just made it so the program can work better like expected.
